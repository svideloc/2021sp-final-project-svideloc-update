### Conclusion

Overall, I learned a ton of new tools and aspects of python in this class. I was able to implement many learnings from this class from advanced python techniques (decorators, abstract classes) to the less python more devops aspects of the repo incorporating jenkins and publishing my repo to nexus for work. Finally, to round out the project I was able to implement visualizations that can help scientist, analysts, and others understand what the algorithm is doing on a micro and macro scale by plotting in matplotlib/plotly, and Google Earth! 

## Next Steps

1. Performance 
As the algorithm takes on more data the Greedy approach is not terribly fast, there are general improvements that can be made to the algorithm to speed up performance

2. Improve Documentation
Create sphinx documentation for the rest of the repository, not just the parts I contributed to.

3. Cookie-Cutter Template
The repo that I created for this task can easily be generalized to many repos I will work with at my job on creating a Cookie-cutter template that I and others can use
